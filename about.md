## About This Project

This project demonstrates a **production-ready approach to unsupervised learning**, emphasizing both **theoretical correctness** and **practical evaluation**. Rather than relying on a single algorithm, multiple clustering techniques are applied and compared using quantitative metrics and visual diagnostics.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Unsupervised Machine Learning
- K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN
- Cluster evaluation using Silhouette & Davies–Bouldin metrics
- Dimensionality reduction with PCA
- Model selection using Elbow & k-distance heuristics
- Data preprocessing for distance-based models
- Analytical reasoning and result interpretation

---

## Why This Matters
Clustering is widely used in:
- Customer segmentation
- Behavioral analytics
- Anomaly detection
- Market research
- Recommendation systems

This notebook reflects **industry-relevant practices**, focusing on robustness, explainability, and reproducibility rather than algorithmic shortcuts.

## Author Notes
The project is structured to mirror how clustering problems are solved in real-world analytics teams: iterative evaluation, metric-driven decisions, and validation through visualization.

Designed for recruiters, reviewers, and practitioners looking for **clean, thoughtful, and scalable ML work**.
